## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of
the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static
project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS
files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the
Udacity Classroom.

## Development

Use `npx http-server -c-1 -o` to run a local development server with no-cache
enabled and automatically opening your browser. Make some changes and
reload the browser and the changes are applied. That's what I did, too.

## ES6

I used several ES6 methods and Javascript too and browser functions which are
only available in the latest modern browsers, e.g. `IntersectionObserver`.

Most of the changes have happened in the `js/app.js` file and some changes for
styling in `styles.css`

## Done

This project finished with some Javascript functions and CSS media query to make the page responsive.
